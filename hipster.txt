In Microsoft Windows, software that relies on Windows Side-by-Side (WinSxS) needs an application manifest, which is an XML document that is either embedded in an executable file or contained in a separate XML file that accompanies it. It bears name, version, trust information, privileges required for execution and dependencies on other components.[1]
